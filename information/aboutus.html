<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: ;"><strong>Last updated October 1, 2024</strong></p>

<p>I'm not sure what to put here, so I will just fill this page with meaningless text, or is it really meaningless? I really don't know, you tell me.</p>
<p>This website was built for beer money, but the problem is that I don't like alcohol, so let's call it soda money because I like drinking sugar free soda.</p>
<p>So about us... I hate to break it to you, there is no us. It is one human being making this website.</p>
<p>My life sucks.</p>
<p>Why did you make a pink website? I actually love pink, but don't tell anyone, I am a man. I wish I could have pink items and a pink room etc. I wish I could wear a sexy pink crop top, but there is only so much you can do as a man. It really looks awful on men.</p>
<p>I actually wish I was a woman, it seems so fun, having a pussy, boobs, being sexy... The problem is I don't want to be a transgender, I'm already a pretty buff dude, there is just too much effort to try being a transgender, and my family would probably think I'm a psychopath. I'm not even into men, at all, I can't get hard to men. I do like cocks though, dick are very nice, I like cum. Everything else about men is pretty gross though, not gonna lie.</p>
<p>I really doubt I could become a transgender woman considering my beard, lack of hair on my scalp, yes I'm balding, but I got a nice beard though, so I got that going at least. I'm a pretty hairy dude, and pretty muscular and not overweight.</p>
<p>When I said I'm not sure what to put here, I knew all along what to write, I think I lied.</p>
<p>I don't even know how I would begin with being a transgender, I don't think that's possible actually, I just look so fucking manly, imagine the manlies man in your head, okay turn it down a bit I'm not that manly, but pretty manly. Yeah how is that supposed to work, don't think me becoming a woman would be possible, well maybe with surgeries, but I don't like surgery, that's scary!
<p>So what do I do with my life? Nothing, it's actually really tragic, my life is awful, I have nothing going for me.</p>
<p>I just sit inside most of the time, sure I do workout a lot in the summer outside but that's about all the time i spend outside, this summer kind of sucked though, 2024 in general kinda sucked.</p>
<p>Lets start with my long list of my problems, and see why I should krill myself (in-game).</p>
<p>Depressed, social anxiety, general anxiety, suicidal, allergic, long covid, balding, tired... I'm just so fucking tired all the time.</p>
<p>No education, no job, no car, no drivers license, no girlfriend, did I mention I have no FUCKING HAIR on my scalp (I want hair).</p>
<p>So why am I still here? Why haven't I offed myself yet? I don't actually really know, I guess I'm scared to do it? Well If I really would do it I would go to a foreign country, Japan? I'm not sure, I'm not a weeb. But I do want to go to a Japanese beach. I would live there until my money were gone, become homeless for fun, and if no one gives me money, I would just choke myself to death with a weight bar at some random gym, I don't know.</p>
<p>If you've read this far, I bet you just say, what the fuck? Yes same, I'm just putting my random thoughts. I never talk about my thoughts, so I guess this is a type of therapy, doesn't really feel like therapy though.</p>
<p>I wish I had money, it really would make my life perfect, it would save my life, it would fix all my problems, honestly. I would never be depressed again.</p>
<p>Talking about money, I wish I had a sugar mommy. That would be sweet, imagine having a girlfriend MILF with a shared bank account, we have sex everyday trying out different positions etc. Man that would also fix all my problems, damn what a life.</p>
<p>I think I'm done now, peace.</p>
